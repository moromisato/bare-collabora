# LibreOffice patches

Patches applied on top of upstream LibreOffice when building it as a library bundle for the `bare-collabora` addon. Each patch is designed to be embedder-agnostic and additive (preserve upstream behavior as the fallback), with the longer-term goal of being upstreamable.

## Cross-cutting

### 001 - `uno-ini-env-override`

Honor `URE_UNO_INI_URI` (and `URE_BOOTSTRAP`) from the process environment when bootstrapping UNO. Lets an embedder relocate `unorc` / `fundamentalrc` outside the install dir without having to drop a file at the hardcoded install-relative path. Falls back to the existing platform-specific paths when unset.

### 002 - `forward-cross-compiling-state`

Pass `cross_compiling=yes` to bundled `./configure` invocations when LO itself is cross-compiling. Without this, some external projects (e.g. those using autoconf) fail their own host/build detection and try to run target binaries on the build host.

### 003 - `skip-install`

Drop the non-MACOSX `install` / `install-strip` targets from the top-level `Makefile.in`. The bundle is consumed via the `instdir/` tree directly; the upstream install target assumes a desktop layout we don't need and trips on missing pieces in a static / cross-built configuration.

### 008 - `unzip-restore-permissions`

After `UnpackedTarball` extraction, `chmod -R u+rwX,go+rX` the tree. Some upstream tarballs ship files without owner-write, which breaks subsequent patch / rebuild cycles when `gbuild` tries to overwrite them.

### 009 - `build-side-lib-ext`

Set `gb_Library_PLAINEXT_FOR_BUILD = .dylib` when `OS_FOR_BUILD == MACOSX`. Upstream hardcodes `.so` for build-side libraries, which breaks cross builds hosted on macOS (the build-machine linker produces `.dylib`).

### 022 - `fontconfig-data-all-platforms`

Build `ExternalPackage_fontconfig_data` on Android, iOS, and Linux too - not just Emscripten and macOS. Embedders on every supported platform need the fontconfig data shipped alongside the static bundle.

### 027 - `conf-for-build-skip-system-libs`

Extend the `CONF-FOR-BUILD` opt-out from system `libxml`, `fontconfig`, `freetype`, and `zlib` to also fire when `_os` is `Android` or `iOS`, not just `Emscripten`. The build-side configure was probing the host's `pkg-config` for `fontconfig >= 2.12.0` (and the others) even when the actual target was a self-contained cross-build that ships these libs internally; on a clean Ubuntu runner without `libfontconfig-dev` the probe fails. The `--with-main-module` defaulting stays Emscripten-only.

### 041 - `lok-jpg-and-calc-txt`

Extend the per-application suffix tables LibreOfficeKit's `saveAs` consults in `desktop/source/lib/init.cxx`. LibreOfficeKit picks the export filter purely from the target suffix and a fixed table per document type, and there is no way to name a filter directly, so a suffix missing from the table fails with `no output filter found for provided suffix` even though the filter exists. Adds `jpg` / `jpeg` for Writer, Calc, Impress and Draw (`*_jpg_Export`, which ship alongside the `png` filters already listed) and `txt` for Calc, mapped to the same `Text - txt - csv (StarCalc)` filter as `csv` - LibreOffice's only plain-text export for spreadsheets. Impress and Draw have no plain-text or Markdown filter at all, so nothing is added there.

## iOS

### 004 - `allow-ios-simulator`

Allow `enable_ios_simulator=yes` on both `arm64` and `x86_64` hosts so the simulator builds on Apple Silicon and Intel Macs. Upstream `configure.ac` only canonicalises `aarch64` for iOS and bakes `arm64` into `HOST_PLATFORM`, `host_cpu_for_clang`, `CPUNAME`, `RTL_ARCH`, and `PLATFORMID`; this patch adds the matching `x86_64` branches.

### 005 - `curl-ios-disable-pipe2`

Force `ac_cv_func_pipe2=no` when configuring bundled curl for iOS. `pipe2` is not part of the public iOS API surface and the autoconf probe succeeds at compile time but fails at link.

### 006 - `install-ios-static-libs`

Extend `ios/CustomTarget_iOS_setup.mk` to mirror every `.a` enumerated by `bin/lo-all-static-libs` into `instdir/<LIBO_LIB_FOLDER>/`, synthesize archives for NSS subtrees that only emit loose `.o` files, and stage `ICU.dat` next to the other program-level resources. Lets downstream consumers link from one location.

### 007 - `ios-icu-data-from-env`

On iOS, accept `LIBREOFFICE_ICU_DATA` as a path override for `ICU.dat`. Falls back to the existing `[bundlePath]/ICU.dat` lookup when unset. Useful when the embedder ships ICU data inside a framework resource directory instead of the main app bundle.

### 025 - `nasm-ios-mach-o`

Add `ios*` to the host-OS case that selects the NASM object format. Without this, an iOS x86_64 simulator host falls through to the `ELF ?` default and `NAFLAGS` ends up `-felf -DELF -DPIC`; the assembler then can't see NASM macros like `collect_args` in libjpeg-turbo's SIMD sources. iOS targets the same Mach-O / Mach-O64 formats as macOS, so this is just extending the existing branch.

### 026 - `nss-ios-use-64`

In `external/nss/ExternalProject_nss.mk`, include `iOS` in the OS filter that passes `USE_64=1 CPU_ARCH=x86_64` to NSS when `CPUNAME=X86_64`. Without `USE_64`, NSS picks the 32-bit code path in `lib/freebl/drbg.c` and `PR_STATIC_ASSERT(sizeof(size_t) <= 4)` fails the compile on a 64-bit iOS simulator host. The `AARCH64` branch on the next line is already OS-agnostic so iOS arm64 isn't affected.

## Android

### 010 - `argon2-android-kernel-name`

Pass `KERNEL_NAME=Linux` to argon2's Makefile when building for Android. Argon2's makefile keys library extensions / link flags off `KERNEL_NAME` from `uname -s`, which returns `Linux` on Android but is unreachable when cross-compiling.

### 011 - `argon2-use-make-ar`

Add a new bundled argon2 patch making its Makefile honor `$(AR)` instead of hardcoding `ar`. Required so the Android NDK's `llvm-ar` is used instead of the build-host `ar`, which produces archives the target linker rejects.

### 012 - `pixman-android-with-pic`

Pass `--with-pic` to bundled pixman's `configure` on Android. Pixman's static archive is linked into a `.so` further down the pipeline; without `-fPIC` the relocations are not valid in a shared object on aarch64.

### 013 - `install-android-static-libs`

Mirror image of patch 006 for Android: after `AllModulesButInstsetNative`, copy every static archive emitted by `bin/lo-all-static-libs` into `instdir/<LIBO_LIB_FOLDER>/` and stage `ICU.dat`. First-wins on basename collisions preserves the upstream link-order semantics.

### 014 - `lo-all-static-libs-android-nss`

Gate the `libxmlsec1-nss.a` reference in `bin/lo-all-static-libs` (Android branch) on `$ENABLE_NSS == TRUE`. When LO is configured `--disable-nss`, xmlsec doesn't build the NSS backend, so the unconditional reference breaks the enumeration. The gate is harmless when NSS is enabled.

### 015 - `libxml2-android-with-pic`

Same rationale as patch 012, for bundled libxml2 on Android.

### 016 - `libxslt-android-with-pic`

Same rationale as patch 012, for bundled libxslt on Android.

### 017 - `android-app-data-dir-fallback`

In `lo_initialize`, when `lo_get_app_data_dir()` returns `NULL` (embedder doesn't use the APK Java bootstrap), fall back to resolving `aAppPath` from the loaded module's URL instead of dereferencing `NULL` through `OUString::fromUtf8`.

### 018 - `osl-dladdr-without-dlapi`

Keep `getModulePathFromAddress()` functional even when `HAVE_UNIX_DLAPI` is 0 (Android sets this because the dynamic-loading API is restricted). `dladdr()` on already-loaded modules still works on Android and is needed by `osl_getModuleURLFromAddress` for embedders that ship LO as static archives inside their own `.so`.

### 019 - `android-null-assetmgr-noent`

In `sal/osl/unx/file.cxx::openFilePath`, treat `lo_get_native_assetmgr() == NULL` as a missing-file condition rather than calling `AAssetManager_open` with a `NULL` manager (which dereferences it). Required for embedders that don't bootstrap LO through the Java/APK wrapper.

### 020 - `resmgr-app-data-dir-fallback`

Mirror of patch 017 for `unotools/source/i18n/resmgr.cxx`: when `lo_get_app_data_dir()` is `NULL`, fall back to the `$BRAND_BASE_DIR`-based path resolution instead of constructing an `OString` from a `NULL` pointer.

### 021 - `android-null-javavm-guards`

Guard every `lo_get_javavm()->Attach/DetachCurrentThread(...)` call in `sal/osl/unx/thread.cxx` and `vcl/android/androidinst.cxx` with a `NULL` check. Embedders that don't bootstrap LO through Java leave `lo_get_javavm()` returning `NULL`; the unguarded calls would crash on every sal thread start and on `AndroidSalInstance` construction.

### 023 - `android-makefile-shared-no-nss`

In `android/Bootstrap/Makefile.shared`, gate the `NSSLIBS` definition and the `$(SODEST)/nss-libraries` link dependency on `ENABLE_NSS == TRUE`. Required to make `--disable-nss` actually link on Android (default-on upstream unconditionally references NSS shared libraries).

### 024 - `native-code-graphic-export`

Add `filter_GraphicExportFilter_get_implementation` to `solenv/bin/native-code.py::core_constructor_list`. Without this entry, `cppuhelper::shlib` can't construct the UNO component backing the PNG / JPEG export filters under `DISABLE_DYNLOADING`, so `Document::saveAs` for any graphic format silently fails with `ERRCODE_IO_CANTWRITE`.

## Windows (MSYS2 + MSVC)

The Windows build uses MSYS2 as a POSIX shell layer over MSVC toolchains. Several patches fix impedance mismatches between MSYS2's path conventions (`/c/…`) and the Windows-style paths (`C:/…`) that autoconf and LO's build system produce.

A `python3w.sh` wrapper is installed alongside the patches and set as `PYTHON_FOR_BUILD`. It converts any `C:/…`-style argument to a POSIX path via `cygpath -u` before forwarding to `/usr/bin/python3`, because MSYS2's Python binary does not perform automatic path translation for script arguments.

### 028 - `msys2-use-cygpath`

In `solenv/gbuild/Helper.mk`, use `cygpath -u` instead of `wslpath -u` to populate the `SRCDIR_WSL` / `BUILDDIR_WSL` / … variables when running under MSYS2 (i.e. `MSYSTEM` is set but `WSL_DISTRO_NAME` is not). Upstream only handled the actual WSL case; this makes `gb_Helper_wsl_path` functional in a plain MSYS2 environment.

### 029 - `fix-include-symlink`

Before `AC_CONFIG_LINKS([include:include])` in `configure.ac`, remove the `include/` directory if it already exists as a real directory rather than a symlink. On Windows, git may check out the symlink target as a plain directory; autoconf's `AC_CONFIG_LINKS` then fails because it can't replace a directory with a symlink.

### 030 - `quote-gnupatch`

Quote `$(GNUPATCH)` in the `UnpackedTarball` patch-application loop in `solenv/gbuild/UnpackedTarball.mk`. On Windows, `GNUPATCH` resolves to a path containing spaces (e.g. `C:/Program Files/Git/usr/bin/patch.exe`); without quoting the shell splits it and the command is not found.

### 031 - `msys2-makefile-use-cygpath`

In `Makefile.in`, use `cygpath -u` to convert `SRCDIR` to a POSIX path when regenerating `config_host.mk` under MSYS2 (non-WSL). Upstream only handled WSL via `wslpath`; without this, `make` passes a Windows-style `SRCDIR` into the makefile infrastructure where MSYS2 expects a POSIX path.

### 033 - `openssl-msys2-perl-fallback`

In `external/openssl/ExternalProject_openssl.mk`, when `MSYSTEM` is set but `STRAWBERRY_PERL` is empty, fall back to the `PERL` detected by configure (MSYS2's own `perl.exe`) instead of expanding to an empty string. Upstream assumes that `MSYSTEM` implies a WSL environment where Strawberry Perl is required; under a native MSYS2 build without Strawberry Perl installed, the empty expansion drops the interpreter and leaves `Configure` as a bare (unfound) command.

### 032 - `icu-wnt-disable-extras`

Pass `--disable-extras` unconditionally to ICU's `./configure` on WNT. The `extra/uconv` subdirectory tries to generate a man page via `config.status` during the build, which fails in the MSYS2/MSVC environment. LibreOffice does not use any ICU extras, so skipping them is safe. Previously `--disable-extras` was only applied for cross-compiled WNT builds.

### 034 - `atl-paths-windows-format`

In `configure.ac`, replace `win_short_path_for_make` with `cygpath -sm` for `ATL_LIB` and `ATL_INCLUDE`. Under MSYS2, `win_short_path_for_make` falls through to its `else` branch which calls `cygpath -u`, producing POSIX-style paths (`/c/...`). MSVC (`cl.exe`) receives those as `-I/c/...` and cannot resolve them; the result is `atlbase.h: No such file or directory` even when ATL is installed. `cygpath -sm` always produces short Windows mixed-style paths (`C:/...`) which MSVC understands.

### 035 - `install-ooo-implibs`

In `solenv/gbuild/platform/com_MSC_class.mk`, add `gb_Library__install_ilib` and call it from `gb_Library_Library_platform` for OOO-layer libraries. This copies each library's import `.lib` alongside its `.dll` in `instdir/program/`, making the `instdir/` tree self-contained for embedders. `RTVERLIBS` and `UNOVERLIBS` are unaffected — their import libraries already land in `instdir/sdk/lib/` via `gb_Library_get_ilib_target`.

### 036 - `nss-msys2-abspath-windows`

In `external/nss/nss.windows.patch`, replace `cygpath -m` with `cygpath -w` inside `pr_abspath` (NSPR's `config/rules.mk`) and `core_abspath` (NSS's `coreconf/rules.mk`). MSYS2's automatic argument conversion mishandles the mixed-form paths produced by `-m` (e.g. `D:/a/…`) when launching Windows-native `cl.exe`: it treats the leading `D:` as a drive prefix and re-converts the trailing `/a/…` to `a:/…`, yielding mangled paths like `D:a:/bare-collabora/…/now.c` that cl.exe can't open. Backslash paths from `-w` are recognised as already-Windows and passed through verbatim.

### 037 - `zip-temp-dir`

Pass `-b .` to every `zip` invocation that writes an archive into a directory it shares with concurrent siblings: autocorrect, both autotext sets, templates, the docbook filter, and the generic `Zip` class. `zip` creates its temporary archive beside its target before renaming, so with dozens running at once two can pick the same temporary name; the loser's file is renamed away underneath it and the next open fails with `zip I/O error: No such file or directory` / `Could not create output file`. Each of these recipes already changes into a per-archive directory, so `-b .` gives every invocation a private location. Passing `.` rather than a path keeps it clear of the MSYS2 path translation the other Windows patches deal with.

Seen twice on Windows in the autocorrect target, with a different language each time - `acor_ru-RU.dat` out of 37 targets, `acor_vro-EE.dat` out of 49 - which is what points at contention rather than anything specific to a document.

Two callers with the same shape are deliberately left alone. `Extension.mk` builds `.oxt` packages, which this port never builds (`--disable-extensions`). `HelpTarget.mk` is not affected at all: it writes `$(HELP_MODULE).jar` relative to the directory it changes into, so its temporary file is already private.

### 038 - `visual-studio-2026`

Teach `configure.ac` about Visual Studio 2026: map the `2026` argument of `--with-visual-studio` to version 18, give 18.x its `vcyear` / `vctoolset` (`v145`), accept the same Windows SDKs as 17.x, and look for `clang-cl.exe` under the architecture subdirectory it moved to in Visual Studio 2026 18.7.0. Backport of upstream `d2def868cb3a`, which `distro/collabora/co-26.04` already carries, and `132bd1cb9baf`, which is on master only.

### 039 - `visual-studio-2026-crt`

`find_msvc_x64_dlls` derives its default path as `Microsoft.VC${VCVER}.CRT` and only corrects it for the versions its `case` names, so Visual Studio 2026 (`VCVER` of `18.0`) keeps a path that does not exist and configure fails with `missing msvcp140.dll`. Add an arm resolving the 2026 redist directory, `redist/MSVC/<version>/x64/Microsoft.VC145.CRT`. Unlike 038 this is not a backport: master deletes the check outright rather than teaching it new versions, and the variables it feeds are consumed by the installer packaging, so removing it is not a small lift on this branch. `with_redist` is left empty for `VC145.CRT`, which is harmless here - the port configures `--without-package-format`, and the only consumer is the `msi` branch.

### 040 - `accpara-text-alias`

Name `SwAccessibleParagraph`'s conversion target through an alias declared at namespace scope. The class derives from nine UNO interfaces, several of which derive from `XAccessibleText`, so the conversion exists to name one path through the hierarchy. Visual Studio 2026 rejects every direct spelling of it:

| Spelling                                            | MSVC 19.51                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| declared in class, defined out of line (as shipped) | `error C2738: ... is ambiguous or is not a member`                                                       |
| defined in the class body                           | `error C2440: cannot convert ... to 'SwAccessibleParagraph::XAccessibleEditableText::XAccessibleText *'` |
| either form qualified from global scope             | same two errors                                                                                          |
| **via a namespace-scope alias**                     | **compiles**                                                                                             |

The `C2440` target type is the tell: the compiler resolves the conversion type through class scope, landing on a base's injected name rather than the namespace type. An alias whose name does not exist in class scope forces lookup out to namespace scope, which is why it is the only spelling that survives.

Upstream solved this differently, by moving the class onto `cppu::ImplInheritanceHelper` so the hierarchy is linear and no conversion is needed (`distro/collabora/co-26.04` and master). That is an inheritance refactor rather than a patch, so it does not lift across to this branch.

Verified against MSVC 19.51.36256 on a Windows ARM64 host, with a reduced reproduction of the class shape rather than a full build.
